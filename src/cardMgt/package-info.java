/**
 This package provides utilities for managing a deck of cards. Think of a
 display screen in the application to be a card. The card is based on the
 JPanel so the visual editing tools can be used to create the windows and
 the cards. The basic idea is that one card can be displayed at a time.
 The package uses the CardPanel class provided by Sun. The CardManager
 facilities communication with the CardPanel.
