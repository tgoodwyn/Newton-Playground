/**
 This package holds the various classes that are based on the Card class. IN
 the example there is only one card of each type where the types are First, Second
 and Third. This need not be the case and multiple copies of the card could be added
 to the deck of cards managed by the CardManger. Since these cards are based on a JPanel
 the visual editing tools in netbeans can be used to create new cards. Simply
 remember that the JPanel extends Card.
