Description:

This project is a 2d game made for CS 321 at UAH in Fall of 2020.  It was made by Tyler Goodwyn, Justin Hopkins, Jake Lee, J.T. Sullivan, and Blake Littrell.

The purpose of the game is to launch a ball and try to land it in a target zone in as few launches as possible.  The game is targeted for Java 1.8 and uses the Swing library for its GUI.

Tyler contributed the creation of a basic 2D game engine that was used to quickly substitute in various art assets made by other team members, as well as a dynamic 2D camera that follows that ball smoothly to prevent motion sickness.
